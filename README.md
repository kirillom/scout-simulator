What you can do:__

Shoot moving bots; headshots grant more points, refill time-slow stamina bar and initiate an instant reload__
Shoot targets, hitting red spots yields same bonuses__
Swing with the grappling hook!__
Try to get the most score in the least time I guess?__

How to play:__

Left-click to shoot, press and hold to aim and slow down time__
Right-click for grappling hook. Hold to swing, press spacebar while swinging to pull yourself to the grappling point__
Press R to return to starting point and reset time__

And a bit of the useless features:__

Shooting pushes you in the opposite direction__
Swinging inherits your velocity and direction but not at all perfectly__
You can jump (MIND-BLOWING)__
Surface has friction, which means braking is slower on higher speeds__
