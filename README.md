What you can do:  

Shoot moving bots; headshots grant more points, refill time-slow stamina bar and initiate an instant reload  
Shoot targets, hitting red spots yields same bonuses  
Swing with the grappling hook!  
Try to get the most score in the least time I guess?  

How to play:  

Left-click to shoot, press and hold to aim and slow down time  
Right-click for grappling hook. Hold to swing, press spacebar while swinging to pull yourself to the grappling point  
Press R to return to starting point and reset time  

And a bit of the useless features:  

Shooting pushes you in the opposite direction  
Swinging inherits your velocity and direction but not at all perfectly  
You can jump (MIND-BLOWING)  
Surface has friction, which means braking is slower on higher speeds
